    "murderhistory": "The police arrive at a diner where, at first glance, it appears to be a man who has had a heart attack. The man was big and you can tell he hasn't lived a healthy life so a heart attack is very likely. You can't see any external injuries on him so no crime is suspected. Well after the autopsy, a suspicion was raised when it was clearly seen that he had high levels of rat poison in his body, the food was checked from the diner which did not show any poison. He therefore cannot have been poisoned at the diner. Further investigation showed that the man was homeless and that he lived on and off in both shelters and also various cheap boarding houses. Above all, it was a boarding house which was particularly interesting as he had lived there for the past year. Can you solve the case? Who is the killer?",

    "murderhistory": "The police are called to a home in a block of flats where the houses are close together. Inside the house they find a woman named Sophia, dead in her bed, it is the woman's sister who called and summoned the police to the scene. The sister is hysterical and has trouble getting words out when the police try to ask her a couple of questions that might give some clue to who the suspect might be. They can't get much out of her other than she came to her sister's house after work called and asked if she had heard anything from Sophia since she hadn't turned up at work that morning. Sophia never misses a day of work, at least not without calling beforehand, which created anxiety in the workplace. The sister went straight to Sophia's house, the door was locked but the car was still parked outside the house. She had to use her spare key to open the lock and enter the house. She called the police immediately when she found Sophia in her bed, the chest was not moving and the lips were completely blue, she could tell she was dead.The police asked the sister to come with them to the station so she could answer further questions once she had calmed down a bit. Meanwhile, they examined the house and the body. No blood, no sign of melee. On the other hand, they could see that she had been strangled with something as she had clear marks around her neck, but they found no murder weapon inside the House. She was wearing a nightgown. It was a hot summer's day and the window was slightly open into the bedroom and that is where one suspects the killer entered.No neighbors had seen or heard anything suspicious.Once inside the police station, you ask a couple of important questions to the sister where valuable information emerged.The sister said that Sophia had had a man who had been stalking her for a long period of time, it wasn't until the last few days that it had started to get really uncomfortable. She contacted the police who did nothing special with that information but asked her to call the police again if she ever feel threatened at home. She had told her sister that it started when she helped a man on the street on her way home from work on a Friday night. He couldn't get a heavy box into his car and she offered to help as she was very helpful by nature. The man thanked her several times and willingly reciprocated by offering a cup of coffee but Sophia kindly declined, she had never seen the person before. After this, she started receiving mysterious calls in the evenings and nights. She also felt watched most of the time when she was out and about in town, at home and at work.In the last days of her life, she called her sister and was terrified when she had received several envelopes in the mailbox with pictures of her walking around in a nightgown in her own home. Along with the pictures were also love letters where the person in question wrote as if they were in a relationship and always ended the letters with I love you Sophia, thank you for being mine. This is what she reported to the police after talking to her sister.A few days later here we are, she is now dead and you did nothing about this, if you had taken her seriously she would be alive today, the sister shouted.Who is the mystery man? Can you help the police solve Sophia's murder?",
